It may seem overly academic and many of you might make the oversight in thinking - 'it does not apply to the real world'. However, if you really engage with the process of learning to conduct a literature review you'll gain the ability to filter out topical noise and make an <strong>informed judgment on what is true and what is false</strong>. In a world of cheap editorial content (e.g. listicle) and fake news such a skill has never been more important.</p> <p>I am sure most of you would have completed or at least have some idea of what a literature review is. However, I have found that students, and until recently myself, struggle when it comes to completing a literature review.  It is all too easy to end up either resorting to low quality sources or being overwhelmed by the sheer quantity and complexity of academic literature.  However, providing you use the techniques I teach you in the module, this need not be the case.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-literature-review"><a href="#what-is-a-literature-review" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a literature review?</h2> <p>A literature review is the process of searching and critically analysing and interpreting the literature that relates to your research topic. Although there are many different types of literature reviews, within this class and for your project we are going to be following a systematic approach. A systematic literature review is one that follows a series of repeatable steps know as a 'protocol'.</p> <h2 id="a-literature-review-protocol"><a href="#a-literature-review-protocol" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> A literature review protocol</h2> <h3 id="_1-pick-a-topic-that-lends-itself-to-academic-inquiry"><a href="#_1-pick-a-topic-that-lends-itself-to-academic-inquiry" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1) Pick a topic that lends itself to academic inquiry</h3> <p>As computing students we think in an applied way, we want to make things, get our hands dirty and get stuck into designing or developing a prototype. For instance, let's say I was interested in making a chat bot to help students learn in higher education. At this early stage I want to try an avoid focussing on the tools and techniques to actually make a chat bot.  Instead, I want to clearly define my problem statement and research question or hypothesis.</p> <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Students when learning complex topics in higher education
