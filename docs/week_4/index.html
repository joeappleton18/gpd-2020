But, first, let's briefly consider what is considered to be a breach of academic conduct. I am sure you have read the <a href="http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2l-student-academic-misconduct.pdf?t=1571046883839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">student academic misconduct policy document<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, yes, such a document exists.  The policy outlines four areas of misconduct which you should be aware of.</p> <p>Plagiarism and collusion are the most serious forms of academic misconduct and can result in a referral to the academic misconduct panel.</p> <ul><li><strong>plagiarism.</strong> Where the student passes off someone else's ideas or work their own. This can be one of the most serious forms of academic misconduct, akin to fraud. It should be noted that outsourcing your work, or getting a third party to do it for you is also plagiarism.</li> <li><strong>collusion.</strong>  Where the student/s in the same cohort knowingly allows their work to be viewed by another student and this work is subsequently incorporated in, or represented as, this students work.</li></ul> <p>Further examples of academic misconduct include falsification and replication, and  could, in theory, see you referred to academic misconduct. However, in reality, you will probably just loose marks.</p> <ul><li><strong>falsification.</strong> where the content of any assessed work has been invented. Lecturers marking your work know what a realistic data set looks like. If it is clear that you have inflated or fabricated your data set, you will more than likely lose marks.</li> <li><strong>replication.</strong> Where a student submits the same or similar piece of work, or substantial sections of the same work, which has already been submitted for any other assessment. This may seem odd, however, the idea is that you should not receive credit twice for a piece of work.</li></ul> <p>Now that the possible breaches of academic integrity have been defined. Let's briefly explore, why universities take academic integrity so seriously.  To understand, these ideas, we firstly need to consider what a university is.</p> <h2 id="what-is-university"><a href="#what-is-university" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is university?</h2> <p><img src="/gpd-2020/assets/img/uni_bol.00334674.png" alt=""></p> <blockquote><blockquote><p>University of Bologna, the worlds first modern university, 1088</p></blockquote></blockquote> <p>What is University?  - Odd question! All of you reading this are in your second year of attending university, so you must know what it is, and its purpose.   The aim, here, is not to be patronising. However, few undergraduates students (and some lecturers!), actually consider what are the wider functions of a university.</p> <p>Universities have, in their modern form, been in existence since the 11th  century.  The first university was in Bologna, Italy in 1088.  As would be the case for many hundreds of years to follow, universities were originally focused on training people for specific professions, in essence, they were a tool for maintaining existing social norms. For instance, Bologna university focused on law. It is, in the interest, of the ruling powers to ensure that individuals are well versed in their laws and religious beliefs.  Such an approach remained the focus of universities for over 700 years.</p> <p>Post 19th century we saw a marked change in universities. They gradually transformed from places teaching rigid bodies of knowledge, dictated by the church and the state, to institutions that actively create new knowledge. This reform can be credited to Wilhelm von Humboldt who invented the modern research university.</p> <div class="warning custom-block"><p>Man is born to inquire and create. And when a man or a child chooses to inquire or create out of his own free choice, then he becomes in his own terms an artist rather than a tool of production or a well-trained parrot. - Humboldt</p></div> <p><img src="/gpd-2020/assets/img/humber.1dd11df0.jpg" alt=""></p> <blockquote><blockquote><p>Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1811</p></blockquote></blockquote> <p>For Humboldt, universities should be decoupled from the church and become a forum to foster debate, knowledge and new scientific inquiry. In 1811,  based on these ideals, he founded Berlin University. These ideas eventually spread across the world, making universities central to new knowledge creation.</p> <p>The idea of knowledge creation is the key difference between university and college/six form. A role of a lecturer in a given university, is, in part to create new knowledge. This is the fundamental difference, between a teacher and a lecturer.  A traditional school teacher teaches a state-provided body of knowledge and does not necessarily have the academic freedom to add to the knowledge base.</p> <p>Now we have defined the role of universities, we can move on to how we can base our ideas on this new knowledge that the university system creates.</p> <h2 id="referencing"><a href="#referencing" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Referencing</h2> <p>Currently academic journals are our main mechanism for sharing and advancing science.  Journal articles, will be your highest quality sources.</p> <p>When we base our work on a given source, journal or otherwise, it is important to credit this source.

You should ensure you read the Solent referencing guide in full, I will not cover it in this article.
