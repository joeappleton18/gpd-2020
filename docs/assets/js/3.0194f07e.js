Over the 10 week period, students attended, weekly, two-hour practical sessions where they undertook basic programming tasks using the programming language Python. Along with human tutor support, students also had access to a custom chat-bot implemented in botman.io.  Students could query the chat-bot, in a natural language style, for programming support. It was identified that while some students found the tool useful the majority noted that it had no effect on their learning.
