# Week 9  -  Framing Your Research  

## Session Schedule 	


This is a very exciting week as we will now begin the process of traveling long path towards completing your final year project. The goal of this session is to orientate you with the idea of a research question or hypothosis. 


## Problem Statement

Before we can dive in and come up with a hypothosis/research question we should have a clearly articulated problem statement (i.e something that our research will address or solve).

A problem statement should:

- Identify an issue 
- Reference the problem using the literature 
- How the research will address the problem 

**example**  

Spam is a unfortunate side effect of all forms of electronic communication. This type of communication is not only annoying but also negatively affects  productivity. According to a government report the estimated cost to the UK economy caused by spam communication in 2018 was estimated to be two hundred and twenty million (Doe 2017). 


This project intends to address the issue of blog comment spam. A spam detection plugin will be made for the popular blogging platform Wordpress. The TensorFlow.js library will be utilised to explore how machine learning can be utilised to solve this problem.


## What Makes A Good Research Question 

I envisage the majority of students projects will revolve around a research question. You may recall me stating in the lecture, research questions are investigative in nature. This lends itself very well to a project where a student is investigating the process of implementing and evaluating some form of artifact. 

A good research question should be: 

**Specific bounded and answerable**

**bad** - how can a mobile application increase fitness?  
**good** - how could the introduction of a social accountability exercise logger increase fitness within a group of 1st year students?  
 

- How can I do/create (or automate doing) X?
- What is a better way to do/create X? 
- In what ways can X have impact on the  social or physical world
- In what ways can technology X be used 
The list above is adapted from (Shaw 2003)


Let's consider some concrete examples along with the sort of methods that we could use to answer our research questions. 

|  Research Question        |      Method          |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| How can I create a progressive mobile application using Google Firebase in order to assists students and academics with referencing?     | Implementation and   Reflection on process and explanation of how the app was created |   
| What is a better way to use technology to assist elderly people access websites? |  Prototype implementation and focus group or interviews held with sample users   |                                 


## What Makes a Good Hypothesis


>> “Hypotheses are single tentative guesses, good hunches – assumed for use in
   devising theory or planning experiments intended to be given a direct
   experimental test when possible”. (Eric Rogers, 1966)

Some of you may choose a Hypothesis over a research question, this is absolutely fine however it will somewhat limit the exploratory freedom you have.  Whereas a research question is open and probing, a hypothesis is deterministic and measurable. 


- test a measurable outcome such as  efficiency/cost  
- Efficiency: X is faster, X is more precise    


A hypothesis is in effect a educated guess about some measurable outcome such as efficiency. An example hypothesis could be:

**A soft network  implementation in a university lab is more efficient than its hardware equivalent**


#### Activity 1 



As a group prepare a 5 min presentation that for a given project delivers a:

-  A problem statement 
-  Research problem, should be underpinned by 1 or 2 citations 
-  A Research question or hypothesis 
-  Proposed methods 

|         |             |
|---------|-------------|
| 10 - 15 mins        |    One member of the group should set up a google slides presentation it should have the following sections: <li> Problem statement  </li> <li> Summary of two similar studies </li>  <li>  Research question or Hypothesis </li> <li> Proposed methods  </li> |
|  15 - 20 mins                    |      As a group decide on a project idea. You should ensure that the idea can be tested empirically| 
|  20 - 60 mins                  |         Complete the presentation     |



### Student Ideas 


- "As a student with dyslexia, I have personally found it difficult to learn how to code. I have realised through the years that visual learning is the way forward. Associating different images and symbols for the text that has been put in front of me. I want to find a way to make it easier for other people like me in the same position, learning a complex subject like coding, made simple." (Web Development Student 2018) 

- "I would like to solve this problem my looking at arears where small to medium sized business could improve their network security. I will address the following questions: What is a network attack? (e.g DDOS), How dangerous can they be? What are the consequences of being exploited? What can be done to prevent them? I will look at case studies to support the readers learning." (Networking Student 2018)

- I will be testing to see whether the e-commerce website www.gourmetdrops.com could generate more traffic and/or sales by optimising the web pages using various UX methodologies
