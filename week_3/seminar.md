 Increasing job prospects is one of the fundamental reasons that students attend university. While getting a degree will certainly help you get a job, you must appreciate  [almost half of all young people in the UK are attending university](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/28/almost-half-of-all-young-people-in-england-go-on-to-higher-education). As such, it is vital that you differentiate yourself from the crowed. Just attending university and gaining a degree is no longer enough.  
 
  As someone who has employed graduates in the past I have first hand incites into what an employer looks for in a prospective candidate.  Employers want to employ graduates that have a clear demonstrable subject interest beyond what they were obligated to study at university. 
 
  
::: tip
 Social capital is the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an
 individual or a group by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less
 institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.   
 (Bourdieu & Wacquant 1992, p.119)

## Social Profile Suggestions

Below are some social profiles that you should consider setting up. We are going for quality over quantity, you should try and set up profiles that that you will engage with. The more you engage, the more you start to accumulate `social capital`.  

### GitHub

If you're a programmer, an active [GitHub](https://github.com/) account with well thought out repositories can go a long way towards showing off your programming skills. 

::: tip

Explore and like [interesting projects](https://github.com/explore). Even better, try and get involved in some open sources projects.

::: 

### Stack Overflow 

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).   I am sure you have all come across answers to programming questions on stack overflow. Not a programmer, then perhaps you've stumbled across many of the stack-exchange sites. Having a active profile on one of these sites can really show off your skills. 

### Twitter

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/).  Twitter is currently my favourite professional networking tool. It's a great way to get your name out there and share interesting content. 


## Linked In 

[Linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com/). LinkedIn, although a bit dated, is nonetheless still an important professional networking tool. As such, you should ensure you have a up to date interesting profile. 

## Industry Specific Sites. 

Sites like [behance](https://www.behance.net/) and [codepen](https://codepen.io/) are specific to the programming and web development industry.
