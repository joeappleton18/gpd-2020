# Week 6  -  Adjourning  

Take a deep breath, your presentations have been completed! I must say, I was very impressed with the quality. 
This seminar session will allow you to focus on a team debriefing.
 
 You should aim to:
  
   - gather together all of the data you've collected throughout this process
   - get any final feedback from your team members
   - discuss summarise and analyse the peer feedback that you've been provided  
   - perhaps revisit the Bruce Tuckman model of team formation and see how it applies to your group
