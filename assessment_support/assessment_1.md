## Sample Student Work 

I have selected a few choice pieces of work that were particularly good.  Your experiences will of course be different, so please just use these pieces of work as a guide. 

### Report 1

This report demonstrated perfect referencing and a critically balanced literature review. Furthermore, the results are very well presented.

### Report 2

This was one of the highest quality pieces of work. As with the report above, it is well formatted. However, this report is also critically aligned with Tuckmanâ€™s theory (see key assessment readings).
