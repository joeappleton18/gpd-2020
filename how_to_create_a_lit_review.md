# How To Conduct Literature Review 

From your perspective I may be the  bearer of bad news, but you will need to complete a comprehensive literature review as part of this unit (Graduate Professional Development) and for your final year project.

You should NOT treat a literature review as a task just to get through. It may seem overly academic and many of you might make the oversight in thinking - 'it does not apply to the real world'. However, if you really engage with the process of learning to conduct a literature review you'll gain the ability to filter out topical noise and make an **informed judgment on what is true and what is false**. In a world of cheap editorial content (e.g. listicle) and fake news such a skill has never been more important. 

I am sure most of you would have completed or at least have some idea of what a literature review is. However, I have found that students, and until recently myself, struggle when it comes to completing a literature review.  It is all too easy to end up either resorting to low quality sources or being overwhelmed by the sheer quantity and complexity of academic literature.  However, providing you use the techniques I teach you in the module, this need not be the case. 


## What is a literature review?

A literature review is the process of searching and critically analysing and interpreting the literature that relates to your research topic. Although there are many different types of literature reviews, within this class and for your project we are going to be following a systematic approach. A systematic literature review is one that follows a series of repeatable steps know as a 'protocol'. 

## A literature review protocol

### 1) Pick a topic that lends itself to academic inquiry

As computing students we think in an applied way, we want to make things, get our hands dirty and get stuck into designing or developing a prototype. For instance, let's say I was interested in making a chat bot to help students learn in higher education. At this early stage I want to try an avoid focussing on the tools and techniques to actually make a chat bot.  Instead, I want to clearly define my problem statement and research question or hypothesis.

**Problem Statement:** Students when learning complex topics in higher education
**Research Question** In what ways can a chat bot assist students learning in higher education




## 2) Develop inclusion and exclusion criteria 

Next, we need to develop and document the inclusion and exclusion criteria for our literature review. Continuing the chat bot 


## 3) Identify databases 

## 4) Identify keywords

Chat Bot, Chat Bot, Higher Education, University, Learning,  

## 4) Conduct searches 

## 5) Review resulting literature 

## 6) Present your findings

- Include your search protocaol


>> A search of the online academic database Scopus was undertaken. The following keywords were used: beginning teacher, new academic, higher education,  practitioners, transitions and academic identities.  The keywords were entered in a variety of combinations, with and without the boolean operators AND and OR. Finally, the search filters that studies should be between 2008 and 2016, based on the transition into higher education institutions, and in a peer-reviewed journal with a UK territory were applied, resulting in fourteen studies (see Table \ref{table:litresults}). These studies acted as a seed for the initial literature review.  On reviewing these studies, frequently occurring citations were investigated and used to support my understanding.



- Summarise studies 







>> Databases follow commands you type in and return results based on those commands. Be aware of the logical order in which words are connected when using Boolean operators: 
Databases usually recognize AND as the primary operator, and will connect concepts with AND together first.
 
If you use a combination of AND and OR operators in a search, enclose the words to be "ORed" together in parentheses.
 
Examples:
ethics AND (cloning OR reproductive techniques)
 
(ethic* OR moral*) AND (bioengineering OR cloning) 



Chatbots AND Learning AND (Higher Education OR Schools OR Secondary Education OR Adult Education OR Adults OR Children)
