There are some ideas in the [assessment 1 brief](/assesments/assessment_1.md) </p> <p> <p> - Groups should decide on a team name </p>- Groups should ensure they decided on what team management tools they are going to use (see Useful Resource - Team Management). Evidence of these tools being used will need to be provided in your final write up </p><p>- Groups will need to meet up in their own time. Presentations will be delivered from the week starting 22-Oct-18. Based off this date a meeting schedule will need to be decided.</p> |

| 70 - 80 mins  | Tutor will share their ideas on some potential data collection methods that could be used to aid the criticality of your write up (e.g. personality profiling, surveys, interviews with team members)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Personality Profiling

The idea that personality types can be neatly categorised based on a series of questions is controversial. However, they are still widely used as a recruitment tool in industry. As such, you may want to get each team member to undertake a Myers Briggs test and record their results. This may prove useful in providing you some added data to reflect on. However, should you go down this route, you should investigate and discuss the limitation of such a study.

#### Team Management Tools

- [Trello](https://trello.com/) - Widely used in industry, Trello is a simplistic project management tool
- [Slack](https://slack.com/lp/two?cvosrc=ppc.google.slack.com&cvo_creative=256925347645&utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=d_ppc_google_uk_en_brand-hv&utm_term=slack.com&cvo_campaign=&cvo_crid=256925347645&Matchtype=e&c3api=5523%2C256925347645%2Cslack.com&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsMHZ_7zT3QIV7pPtCh2RCwGcEAAYASAAEgLavvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CKrkhIG9090CFZKeGwodP0ECXA) - Slack has changed the way I communicate within a team setting. It's by far the best tool I have used for organising team communication. As such, I highly recommend you use it for facilitating communication within your team.

## Important Reading

We will be using Tuckman's seminal work on group development as a tool to aid critical reflection. As such you should read the following papers:
