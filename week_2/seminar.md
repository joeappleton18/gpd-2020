# Week Two - Analysing Sources 

The purpose of this session is to start the process of understanding how to locate original sources based secondary interpretations. 

**By the end of this session you should:**


- Understand the critical appraisal framework
- Analysed the two articles by Tuckman 
- Be able to conduct basic searches for literature on Google Scholar 
- Appreciate that you can not believe what you read, watch or hear.

## Tasks 

### 1 Analysing student work

Throughout this unit the primary readings will be peer reviewed papers. Such pieces of work are often constructed by teams of experienced researchers. Typically, the final polished version has gone through many iterations of corrections and refinements. As a student, even as a postgraduate, creating work to this standard is far beyond the scope of a module assessment. The purpose of this task, is to try and get you thinking critically by evaluating the work of your peers. 

I have selected two assessments (see below) from the last iteration of this unit. In your teams, read, discuss and using the [marking rubric](/assessments/assessment_1.html#assessment-criteria) for this assessment,try to grade the below pieces of work.

### 2 Obtaining the underlining data

As scientists and future graduates it is important we do not simply accept everything we see, hear or read. The purpose of this exercise is to begin the process of honing your skills at unearthing scientific literature.


Consider the following article titled "[A Glass Of Red Wine Is The Equivalent To An Hour At The Gym, Says New Study](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/08/a-glass-of-red-wine-is-the-equivalent-to-an-hour-at-the-gym-says-new-study_n_7317240.html)", it is a wild claim, but reality is it based on? 

Within your groups, see if you can locate, read and discuss the original research paper that this article was based on.

::: tip
-  [Google Scholar](https://www.google.co.uk/scholar) can be used to search for academic papers and author profiles. 
-  You should note that most journal articles are behind pay walls. If this is the case you should login using your university credentials (via Shibboleth).

### 3 Critically analysing Tuckman's papers

We are going to be using Tuckman's model of small team development for assessment 1. As such you will need to read and critically analyse the following papers:


[TUCKMAN, B. 1965. Developmental sequence in small groups.  *Psychological Bulletin*, 63(6), 384â€“399](/reading/Tuckman_1965.pdf) 

[TUCKMAN, B. AND A. JENSON,1977.  Stages of Small-Group Development Revisited. *Group & Organization Studies*, 2(4),419-427](/reading/Tuckman_1977.pdf)



We can get a lot of this work done in this session. This task involves each team member reading the above
papers, this will take some time. When everyone has read both of the papers, you should attempt to, as a group, critically analyse the papers. The analysis should be conducted by answering the below questions:
