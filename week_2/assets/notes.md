- article is to review the literature dealing with the developmental sequence in small groups,
- groups were clustered in accordance to similarity

>>  Such groups contain from 5 to IS
    members, each of whom has some debilitating
    personal problem, and a therapist, and
    the group exists for 3 months or more. The
    developmental data for such groups consist
    of the observations of the therapist and
    those professional observers that are present,
    usually as trainees. Such data are highly
    anecdotal in nature and reflect the clinical
    biases of the observers. [..]

    must be limited by the limitations of the
    setting and the mode of data collection

- The literature that has been reviewed can
  be criticized on a number of grounds. First,

  cannot be considered truly representative of
  small-group developmental processes, since
  certain settings have been overrepresented,
  primarily the therapy-group setting, and
  others underrepresented, primarily the natural-group
  and laboratory-group settings
