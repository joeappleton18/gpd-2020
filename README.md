# Welcome to the notes for Graduate Professional Development

At its core this unit will explore three key questions:

- What is the purpose of modern university education and the learning that takes place within these institutions?

- What is science, and how do I access scientific bodies of work?

- What are the social, political, philosophical and ethical dilemmas caused by ever-advancing technology?

By then end of this unit, you should be able to answer the questions above.

In addressing these questions you will need to learn how to take a critical approach to evaluating ideas, concepts and theories. Your criticality will be expressed in the form of two written pieces of work.

## Assessments
