## Assessment Task

The purpose of this assessment is to prepare an academically styled report that critically reflects
on a team presentation. The presentation will have been delivered as part of the practical component
of this course. Your final report will be 2000 words in length, roughly following the outlined
report structure (see Suggested Report Structure). It must be noted, you are marked on the quality of your individual reflective report, not the presentation delivered.

Groups will be formed in week 1 of the semester. Each group will then work together in order
to create a informative presentation on a technical topic of their choosing, presentations will be
delivered in the last week of October.

Presentation topics will be collaboratively determined between group members - they should be in a technical/scientific field. Below are some ideas:

- The application and implications of block chain
- Crypto currencies
- Ethical and technical considerations of autonomous vehicles
- Social media and data privacy
- Artificial intelligence and its impact on future employment
- Robotics: how and where might they be used in the future?
- Smart cities
- Digital design for minorities
- Deep learning

## Supplementary Employability Task

As a supplementary task you will also be required to work on employability through the creation of
a CV and important on-line social profiles. You should provide evidence that these tasks have been completed in the appendix of your report.

## Assessment Criteria

You will be assessed on your ability to critically assess and reflect on the overall process of working in and forming groups. To assist you in this process you are encouraged collect evaluative data from your team members.

Data can be obtained through many different sources. It is a good idea to use more than one source, such an approach will add robustness to your results. Some possible data sources include, but are not limited to: conducting team interviews, distributing a survey amongst team members and extracting and evaluating conversation that took place over messenger applications such as Slack and WhatsApp.

### Learning Outcomes

This assessment will enable students to demonstrate in full or in part the learning outcomes identified in the unit descriptors.

### Late Submissions

Late Submissions:

i. If this assessment is submitted late i.e. within 5 working days of the submission deadline, the mark will be capped at 40% if a pass mark is achieved;  
ii. If this assessment is submitted later than 5 working days after the submission deadline, the work will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero;  
iii. If this assessment is being submitted as a referred piece of work (second or third attempt) then it must be submitted by the deadline date; any Refer assessment submitted late will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero.

### Extenuating Circumstances

The University’s Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If students are not 'fit to study’, they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer). In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence. If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested. Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact the Student Hub for advice.

A summary of guidance notes for students is given below:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1534423896787](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1534423896787)

### Academic Misconduct

Any submission must be students’ own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The University’s Academic Handbook includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct. Students should check this link before submitting their work.

Procedures relating to student academic misconduct are given below:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/support/official-documents/information-for-students/complaints-conduct/student-academic-misconduct.aspx](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/support/official-documents/information-for-students/complaints-conduct/student-academic-misconduct.aspx)

### Ethics Policy

The work being carried out by students must be in compliance with the Ethics Policy. Where there is an ethical issue, as specified within the Ethics Policy, then students will need an ethics release or an ethical approval prior to the start of the project.

The Ethics Policy is contained within Section 2S of the Academic Handbook:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2s-university-ethics-policy.pdf](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2s-university-ethics-policy.pdf)

### Grade marking

The University uses a letter grade scale for the marking of assessments. Unless students have been specifically informed otherwise their marked assignment will be awarded a letter grade. More detailed information on grade marking and the grade scale can be found on the portal and in the Student Handbook.

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2o-annex-2-assessment-regulations-grade-marking-scale.pdf?t=1534424273208](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2o-annex-2-assessment-regulations-grade-marking-scale.pdf?t=1534424273208)
