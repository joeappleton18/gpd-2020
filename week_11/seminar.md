### Introduction



In groups of 3 - 4 work through the below examples of real student projects. 

As we have done before, a member of the team should set up google slides presentation. 

You should answer the following questions:

1. What data collection methods would you use?
2. How would you store the data that you have collected?
3. How would you analyse the data that you have collected?

Where possible, you should underpin your choices with evidence in the form of good quality citations. Try and be creative in considering how to construct a well designed research methodologies.



#### Example 1 

University students can be seen as an easy target to scammers, especially when they are living away from home in an unfamiliar environment. In light of this, the following study explores the different ways a Progressive Web Application (PWA) can increase university studentâ€™s awareness on the latest scamming tactics. 


#### Example 2

Computer games are mostly known only for entertainment purposes and in many cases educational games are getting underestimated from parents and teachers. However, new studies reveal that educational games used by teachers in the classrooms have proved to have positive results in both students and teachers experience (De Aguilera, M. and Mendiz, A. 2003). This project is about the teaching of computer networks using a 3D game created in a game engine. 


#### Example 3 

Infra-red amongst others has become a very popular medium of communication particularly, in a defined sphere where external network (internet) communi- cation is unbefitting. However, constraints such as limited connectivity range hinders the prominence of employed devices that are based on these technologies protocol.

This project applies a device on device communication that embraces a mesh network topology as a technique for extending communication range between network nodes. 


#### Example 4

This project is centred around the design and implementation of a small scale Virtual Learning Environment, that enables schools and teachers to create and share long-form learning materials to the pupils within their classes. This project was chosen because many primary and secondary schools are unable or reluctant to purchase expensive, overwhelming software for their staff and pupils.
