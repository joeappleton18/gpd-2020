# Week 4 - Academic  integrity Avoiding Plagiarism

‘Plagiarism’ involves taking the thoughts, ideas, words, arguments, results or conclusions of another person and using them as if they were your own, without acknowledgement or consent. It also applies to media such as graphs, illustrations, webpages and computer codes.

::: warning
This seminar is important, within this unit we will be taking a zero tolerance approach towards plagiarism.
::: 

Plagiarism is unethical, wrong and goes against everything we are here to do. We are here to
learn, to find out more and to develop our intellect and scholarly ability. We can only do this if
we work hard and develop our academic skills to the best of our ability.

## Plagiarism and Ethics Task



The purpose of this session's task is to, in your groups, help us build a collaborative resource 
that can be used to help second year computing and networking students avoid plagiarism.  

Within your project groups, you should conduct research and provide advice, guidance, information and tips about how other students can avoid plagiarising.  You should share this advice on the padlet link provided by your tutor.  

:::tip
 You should be as useful, practical and creative as possible. 
:::

This is a beneficial activity to undertake because you must first understand, and become familiar with, what is meant by plagiarism before you can offer advice to others.


Consider discussing and sharing the following points: 

 -  Understand what is meant by plagiarism and what it covers
 -  Use the correct referencing procedure
 -  What are block quotes?
 -  Think about plagiarism in relation to social media or tweeting
 -  Is paraphrasing plagiarism?
 -  What's the difference between summarising and paraphrasing?
